### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `PersonCountPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add Person feature

This command allows a user to add a contact (Student/Parent) into EduConnect. You cannot add duplicate contacts into EduConnect.
<br>Definition of Duplicate Contact: A contact with the **same name** as an existing contact.
<br>Tutors often manage dozens of students and their parents.
To keep their contact list concise and organised, EduConnect prevents duplicate contacts (same name) from being added.
This ensures data integrity and reduces the risk of confusion during communication or scheduling.

The following **truncated** activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes an add person command:

![AddPersonTruncatedActivityDiagram](images/AddPersonTruncatedActivityDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram **fully** summarizes what happens when a user executes an add person command:

### Edit Person feature

The following **truncated** activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes an edit person command:

![EditPersonTruncatedActivityDiagram](images/EditPersonTruncatedActivityDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram **fully** summarizes what happens when a user executes an edit person command:

![EditPersonActivityDiagram](images/EditPersonActivityDiagram.png)

### Remark feature

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a remark command:

![RemarkActivityDiagram](images/RemarkActivityDiagram.png)

### Add Session feature
For the Add Session command, only the standard day formats — Mon, Tue, Wed, Thur, Fri, Sat, Sun or their full forms 
(e.g., Monday, Friday) are accepted to keep inputs consistent.

However, the View Session command is more flexible and also recognizes Thu or
Thurs for convenience.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes an addsession command:

![AddSessionActivityDiagram](images/AddSessionActivityDiagram.png)

### Delete session feature

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a delete session command:

![DeleteSessionActivityDiagram](images/DeleteSessionActivityDiagram.png)

### ViewSession (day-only)

To give more flexibility, we will allow 

**Intent**  
List all students who have at least one session on a specified weekday, ordered by the earliest start time on that day. Supports both legacy single `SessionSlot` and the newer multi-session `Student.sessions`.

---

**Command format**

```text
viewsession: List all sessions on a day; earliest first.
Parameters: d/DAY
Example: viewsession d/Tuesday
```
![ViewSessionClassDiagram](images/ViewSessionClassDiagram.png)

![ViewSessionActivityDiagram](images/ViewSessionActivityDiagram.png)

### Edit session

The `edit session` command modifies an existing session in the address book. The implementation involves the following steps:

1. **Parsing**: The command is parsed to extract the relevant information such as the index of the student, the day and time of the session, and the new day and time of the session if applicable.
2. **Validation**: The command is validated to ensure that the index of the student is valid and that the new day and time of the session (if applicable) are valid.
3. **Execution**: The session is modified in the address book. If the new day and time of the session are applicable, the session is updated with the new day and time. Otherwise, the session is deleted.
4. **Committing**: The address book state is committed to the `addressBookStateList`. The `currentStatePointer` is not changed as the user is not undoing or redoing any commands.
5. **Saving the state**: The `addressBookStateList` is saved to disk to persist the state of the address book.

### Implementation

The edit session mechanism is facilitated by `EditSessionCommand` and `EditSessionCommandParser`. It extends `Command` and implements the following key operations:

* `EditSessionCommand#execute()` - Executes the command to edit a session
* `EditSessionCommand#toCopy()` - Creates a new `Person` with the updated session
* `EditSessionCommandParser#parse()` - Parses the user input and creates a new `EditSessionCommand`

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the edit session mechanism behaves at each step.

#### Example Usage Scenario

1. The user executes `editsession 1 d/Mon ti/12pm-1pm d/Tue ti/1pm-2pm` to change a session from Monday 12pm-1pm to Tuesday 1pm-2pm for the first student in the list.
2. The `AddressBookParser` identifies the command word `editsession` and creates a new `EditSessionCommandParser`.
3. The `EditSessionCommandParser` parses the arguments and creates a new `EditSessionCommand` with the provided index, old session details, and new session details.
4. The `EditSessionCommand` is executed, which:
    - Retrieves the target student from the filtered person list
    - Verifies the student exists and has the specified session
    - Creates a new `Student` object with the updated session
    - Replaces the original student with the updated one in the model
    - Updates the filtered person list

#### Activity Diagram

![EditCommandActivityDiagram.png](images/EditCommandActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: How edit session executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a new Student object with updated sessions
    * Pros: Immutable objects ensure thread safety and make the code easier to reason about
    * Cons: Slight performance overhead due to object creation

* **Alternative 2:** Modify the existing Student object
    * Pros: Better performance as no new object is created
    * Cons: Mutable state can lead to bugs in a multi-threaded environment

**Aspect: Error handling:**

The command includes comprehensive error handling for cases such as:
- Invalid index
- Missing or invalid parameters
- Non-existent session
- Attempting to edit a non-student's session

#### Performance & Efficiency
2. Should be able to hold up to 1000 persons without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
3. A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
#### Reliability & Availability
4. The application should not crash or lose data under normal usage conditions (adding, viewing, deleting contacts).
5. The application should be able to recover gracefully from invalid inputs without terminating unexpectedly.
#### Usability
6. Error messages should be clear, concise, and actionable, enabling the user to correct mistakes quickly.
